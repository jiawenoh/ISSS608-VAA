<p>We would like to create a master ID data frame from the knowledge graph. As there might be <code>source</code> or <code>target</code> that are not reflected in <code>MC3_nodes</code>. The code below select the <code>source</code>, <code>target</code> column individually and concatenate it through <code>rbind()</code>. Thereafter, a <code>left_join()</code> is used to append into <code>MC3_nodes</code> data frame.</p>
<p>Additionally, we rename the <code>id</code> to <code>label</code> and create an <code>id</code> column through <code>mutate()</code> and <code>nrow()</code> . Similarly, we rename the <code>source</code> and <code>target</code> to <code>sourcelabel</code> and <code>targetlabel</code> respectively and use <code>left_join()</code> to append the <code>id</code> before renaming it.</p>

<p>In this section, we will design plots with interactivity for users to explore the data. The plots are created with the use of <code>[giraph]</code>, and <code>[treemap]</code> packages. We examine the distribution by type for nodes and edges , the distribution of the revenue, and the distribution by country with divergent into type.</p>
<p>Bar chart is chosen to show segments of information by comparing different categorical variables. Aggregation is first performed before creating the interactive graph. Moreover, <code>tooltip</code> is used to highlight the count of the data while <code>scale_fill_manual()</code> is used to standardize the color in each graph.</p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Distribution by Type : There are three categories in Nodes and two categories in Edges. We observed that there are only Beneficial Owner and Company Contact in Edges whereas Company information is only available in Nodes. Therefore, we can infer that the type in Edges refer to the connection/ownership that the people are often associated with.</p></li>
<li><p>Distribution by Revenue: As observed, the distribution is right-skewed with higher proportion in $10k to $100k, followed by revenue &lt;$10k. The counts decreases as revenue bins increases. There are eight ID who earns more than $100M in revenue. However, more research have to be done to be able to determine if the revenue gain is achieved over time or in a specifc time period that reciprocate to its strength, size, or selling proposition.</p></li>

<li>Distribution by Country: Among the countries, <code>ZH</code> has the highest size and it contains the darkest gradient that belongs to Beneficial Owner. Meanwhile, the rest of the countries only have information about the <code>company</code> .</li>

<h1>6. Network Visualization and Analysis</h1>
<p>Based on the distribution by type, we could like to explore the network distribution to identify anomalies. We create two separate networks to focus on <code>Beneficial Owner</code> and <code>Company Contacts</code> individually. We compute the centrality between the nodes, by using the <code>graph_from_data_frame</code> function from the <code>[igraph]</code> package.</p>
<p>We used <code>Betweenness Centrality</code> in our network to identify nodes who may have considerable influence instead of other centrality. <code>visNetwork</code> is used to plot the plot the interactive network graph with the <code>Fruchterman and Reingold</code> layout.</p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Majority of Beneficial Owner have exclusivity or a partnership with 1-2 owners per company. However, we identified companies such as <code>Dutch Oyster Sagl Cruise ship</code> , <code>Ola de la Costa N.V.</code> , <code>Niger Bend AS Express</code> , and <code>Bahia de Plata Submarine</code> with relatively high ownership.</p></li>
<li><p>Similarly, the Company Contacts maintains exclusivity/partnership with the liaise company. As observed, there are 1 company who maintain high contacts. In addition, there are personnel who form multiple connections with Companies. For instances, <code>Jennifer Johnson</code> have 5 connections, <code>David Smith</code> have 4 connections, and <code>John Williams</code> have 3 connections.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="identify-connections" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identify-connections">6.1 Identify Connections</h2>
<p>From the network visualization, we noticed that there are people with high ownership/connections. Henceforth, a bar chart is plotted to get a better visualization of their connections. Since we are identifying anomalies, we aggregated the data and filtered away exclusivity of count equals to one.</p>

<ul>
<li>As the ownership/connections increases, the frequency decreases. Henceforth, to detect the anomalies, we would look into Beneficial Owner with 4 or more companies, and Company Contacts with 3 or more.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="identify-personnel">6.2 Identify Personnel</h2>
<p>To identify the personnel with high ownership/connections, we will <code>filter()</code> them based on the criteria above and concatenate it through <code>rbind()</code>. Thereafter, we use <code>distinct()</code> to ensure that there is no duplicate ID and a <code>left_join()</code> to append from <code>MC3_edges_addID</code> data frame.</p>
<p>With the finalized table, <code>datatable()</code> from <code>[DT]</code> package is used to display <code>MC3_anomalies</code> as an interactive table with search, sorting features.</p>

<h1>7. Product and Services</h1>
<p>Since we are unable to gain insights based on the revenue, we would like to look into the business’s most important features - the product and services offered. Given an unique selling point, a product/service determine the prospect of the business.</p>
<p>To begin with, we will perform text sensing by using the <code>[tidytext]</code> package. We used tokenisation to break up the given text into units called tokens. The unit could be an individual words, phrases or the entire sentences. Thereafter, <code>unnest_token()</code> is used. The unnested text goes to the output column - <code>word</code> after extracting it from <code>product_services</code>.</p>

<p>From the table above, we noticed that there are word that might not be useful for our analysis. E.g. <code>and</code> in row 6. Therefore, we would like to exclude such word in our analysis. From the code chunk below, <code>stop_words()</code> from the <code>[tidytext]</code> package is used to aid us in the filtering progress while <code>anti_join()</code> from the <code>[dplyr]</code> package is used to remove all stop_words from the analysis.</p>

<p>As observed, the word <code>and</code> has been removed from the analysis and have been replaced with <code>buses</code>. Despite so, it seems that the extracted word could be further categorized into a broader category.</p>
<section id="word-frequency" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="word-frequency">7.1. Word Frequency</h2>
<p>To get a better graphical representations of the word frequency, a <code>word cloud</code> is used to give greater prominence to words that appears more frequently in a source text. General words such as <code>character</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>unknown</code>, <code>including</code> and <code>related</code> that do not bring insights are removed from the frequency count. Thereafter, we create a dataframe <code>stopword_removed_freq</code> through the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>filter(!)</code> to remove generic word</p></li>
<li><p><code>group_by()</code> word and <code>summarize()</code> by counting the frequency</p></li>
<li><p><code>arrange(desc())</code> to sort in descending order</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>[worldcloud2]</code> package is used for easy and quick insights to the text. For standardization, <code>set.seed()</code> is incorporated.</p>

<p><strong>Observations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Fish remains the top keyword for the word cloud. However, there are multiple words that are not grouped within the fish categories <em>(E.g. Shellfish, Tuna, Crab, Squids)</em></p></li>
<li><p>Given that the knowledge graph should focus on fishing related companies, the word cloud identified words that are not affiliated with fishing. Words such as <code>bags</code>, <code>shoes</code>, <code>metal</code>, <code>power</code> have higher frequency count. Therefore, they will be further categorized into broader group.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="grouping-words-into-categories">7.2 Grouping Words into Categories</h2>
<p>With the aid of the word cloud, we are able to group words into various categories. We begin by creating a custom stop words data frame to remove generic words that we deemed as unsuitable. Words like <code>additional</code>, <code>range</code> may not be part of the <code>stop_word()</code>. While creating the new data frame with a <code>category</code> column, we filtered away numbers and special character that appears in the <code>word</code> column.</p>
<p><code>grepl()</code> is used to extract words that could easily be extracted <em>(E.g. fish)</em> while <code>mutate()</code> is used to match word in a list. We identified <strong>17 categories,</strong> ranging from Fish, Other Food, Transportation to Apparels and Fashion. Unidentified word are filtered away from our analysis.</p>

<p>While generating the categories above, we created the <code>check_text</code> data frame to cross check on high frequency words. After running the code chunk above, the identified list below helps to examine the words that might have been missed.</p>
<p>As such, we <code>filter()</code> only for category in <code>other</code>. Given that we are only interested in word with high frequency, we did a frequency counts and examine through the top-down approach.</p>

<p>Notably, the word above remain unidentified as they might be too generic or they could potentially belong to more than one category. For instance, Frozen could be applicable to Fishing, or to other type of Food. Thus, it is better to remain unidentified as the keyword in the product/service would still be identified.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distribution-of-identified-word-in-each-category">7.3 Distribution of Identified Word in each Category</h2>
<p>A <code>treemap</code> displays hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles, where each group is represented by an area that is proportional to its value. Based on our categorization, we would like to look into the distribution by our <strong>design category</strong> and the <strong>word i</strong>nvolved.</p>
<p>Based on the frequency count, we are able to identify categories that are not part of the fishing. We will aggregate from <code>stopwords_removed_new</code> data frame by using the <code>[dpylr]</code> package:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>group_by()</code> is used to aggregate it by <strong>category</strong> and <strong>word</strong></p></li>
<li><p><code>summarize()</code> is used to compute the <strong>count</strong></p></li>
<li><p><code>arrange(desc())</code> to sort weight in descending order</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We build our treemap by inputting our aggregated data frame (<code>clean_text</code>) into the <code>treemap()</code> function and saved it as an object called <strong>it.</strong> Thereafter, the <code>d3tree</code> function from the <code>[d3treeR]</code> package is used to build our interactive treemap.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="analyzing-apparel-and-fashion">7.4 Analyzing Apparel and Fashion</h2>
<p>In this section ,we will analyse more about the Apparel and Fashion category to see the businesses in this group are similar in nature. We begin by creating a new dataframe - <code>apparel_type</code> by aggregation. An interactive pie chart is used as the number of categories are small and we suspect that the differences among the type will be significant.</p>

<h1>8. Conclusion</h1>
<p>In our exercise, we observed the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Abnormality in business groups based on the type. From the network graph and point of contact, we identified multiple people with high ownership/ large connections.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple words that are not associated with fishing related business. The identified keyword are distinct and could be categorized into broader group.</p></li>
<li><p>Apparel and Fashion is one of the largest category that mainly includes companies and they have wide operation in various countries.</p></li>
</ul>
